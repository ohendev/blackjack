# blackjack
a simple blackjack game based on acknapp's project: https://github.com/acknapp/BlackJack

I love playing cards games, explored github and was intersted in Andrew's java blackjack...
so I wanted to iterate on its base.

minor fix:
- removed unused or not essential parameters

major fix:
- determineCardValue() now returns 10 for a card named 10 instead of 1


structure changes:
- separation of java classes for a better project structure
- adding new classes to separate the game and the utils logics
